# Project2_Vizualization

App.py installation 

go to  At anaconda shell install the following 

pip install flask
pip install flask_pymongo 
pip install dnspython

then type the following command to start the flask ( this will take at least 2 min to start.) The delay is because of the DB connection to the 
cloud ( Atlas) which ends up pulling all data form the db. so wait for couple min for the flask server to start.

python app.py
